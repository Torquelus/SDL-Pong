# SDL Pong

### Description

This is a personal project I worked on in 2018. I wanted to learn more about generating graphics since so far I'd only had experience creating console applications for C.

For graphics and input handling I used a library called [SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://www.libsdl.org/). This handles creating the window, handling input, and drawing graphics. I learned SDL by following a [tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/) that explained how to set up your environment and how SDL works in general.

While I used a tutorial to teach myself SDL, this project itself I created myself using what I had learned. I used this project as a way to solidify my knowledge and to try out SDL in a real world setting. I also used classes here to get more used to OOP, which helped a lot with making the code easier to use.

### Running

This repository comes with pre-built binaries, so you don't need to set up anything for building the project.

To run SDL Pong, navigate to `bin/Debug` and run `Pong.exe`.
